# smallpolarity, A small PCB that protects against wrong polarity.
This PCB board is 17mm in diameter, it has a four P-Channel SSM3J355R,LF channel mosfets that is capable of tolerating 20V 6A each. It should be fairly simple to solder, even that it is surface mounted. It does not conduct any electricity if subjected to the wrong polarity. It has two solder pads,the one on the DC protected side can be soldered to the top of your existing drivers spring. There is also two DC- or ground connections, I suggest a AVG 15 (1.45 mm diameter ) flexible wire for this usage. The + IN unprotected side goes to the batteries. DC OUT to the driver spring, as this is the protected side.

BOM: four P-Channel SSM3J355R
