# smallpolarity
. It should be fairly simple to solder, even that it is surface mounted. It does not conduct any electricity if subjected to the wrong polarity. It has two 13mm solder pads,the one on the DC protected side can be soldered to the top of your existing drivers spring. There is also a DC- or ground connection, I suggest a AVG 15 (1.45 mm diameter ) flexible wire for this usage. The DC+ unprotected side goes to the batteries.
